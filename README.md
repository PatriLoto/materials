## How to get the workshop materials

### Make this repo your own

You can click the green [Use This Template](https://github.com/presentable-user2021/materials/generate) button above to create a repo in your own GitHub account generated from these materials. 

If you choose this route, you can open this project in RStudio by clicking on **New Project** > **Version Control** > **Git** and then paste the URL of the new repo in the dialogue box.

You could skip the dialog boxes and open the project directly with the [usethis] package:

```r
usethis::create_from_github(
  "<your_github_acct>/materials",
  destdir = "~/Desktop/presentable-user2021"
)
```

_Hint: replace `<your_github_acct>` with your GitHub user name and pick a comfortable `destdir`._

### Just download the materials right now

If you'd rather just get the materials without using GitHub or Git in any way, you can also use the [usethis] package:

```r
usethis::use_course("presentable-user2021/materials")
```

usethis will work with you to put the files somewhere reasonable, but you can also be explicit:

```r
usethis::use_course(
  "presentable-user2021/materials",
  destdir = "~/Desktop/presentable-user2021"
)
```
